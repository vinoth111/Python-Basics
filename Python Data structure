Four built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, are List,Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, 

LIST:
1.List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
2.List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
syntax for LIST:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)


Tuple:
1.Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
2.Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
Syntax for Tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)


Sets:
1.Set items are unordered, unchangeable,unindexed and do not allow duplicate values.
