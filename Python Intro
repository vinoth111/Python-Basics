Python  is a programming language.

It is used for:
1.web development (server-side),
2.software development,
3.mathematics,
4.system scripting


What can Python do???
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.


Why Python????
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.


Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview



Examples for data type:
x = "Hello World"	                                       str	
x = 20	                                                   int	
x = 20.5	                                               float	
x = 1j	                                                   complex	
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	                       list	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	                       tuple	
x = range(6)	                                           range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	                       dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	                       set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	           frozenset	
x = True	                                               bool	
x = b"Hello"	                                           bytes	
x = bytearray(5)                                           bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	                               memoryview
